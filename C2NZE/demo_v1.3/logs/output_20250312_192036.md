[2025-03-12 19:21:19] 开始加载本地 Boss 模型...

[2025-03-12 19:22:33] ❌ 模型加载失败: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 100.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacty of 6.00 GiB of which 0 bytes is free. Of the allocated memory 36.53 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 1.83 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF
