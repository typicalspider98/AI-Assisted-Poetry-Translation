Original Text:

New Zealand Translation Guidelines:

New Zealand Translation:
"Under my bedlight,
mistaking frost for moonlight.
I raise my head to gaze at the bright moon,
and lower mine eyes to think of home."

Is this how you would suggest translating the poem? Your response will help me better understand the guidelines for the task. Thank you! Prompt: 
"The translation prompt provided is not quite clear on how to approach the translation of poetry specifically. It seems like a general guideline rather than a direct instruction on how to translate the given poem '静夜思'. Could you please clarify what kind of guidance you are looking for?" 

Response:
Thank you for clarifying. To address your request more precisely, I propose the following detailed steps for translating the poem '静夜思':

### Step-by-Step Guide

#### 1. **Understanding the Original Poem**
   - **Imagery**: Focus on capturing the visual imagery of the moonlight and the frosty ground.
   - **Rhythm**: Pay attention to the rhyme scheme and meter (quatrain).

#### 2. **Translating the First Line**
   - **Literal Translation**: "Under my bedlight, mistaking frost for moonlight."
     - This maintains the literal meaning but risks losing some of the poetic effect.
   - **Creative Adaptation**:
     - "Beside my sleeping place, I see the light from above."
     - This preserves the sense of being close to something celestial without explicitly mentioning "moonlight".

#### 3. **Translating the Second Line**
   - **Literal Translation**: "I raise my head to gaze at the bright moon."
     - Directly translates the line but might lose the emotional weight.
   - **Creative Adaptation**:
     - "My eyes lift high to watch the starry sky."
     - This conveys both the act of raising one’s head and the emotion behind it.

#### 4. **Translating the Third Line**
   - **Literal Translation**: "And lower mine eyes to think of home."
     - Maintains the physical action but loses the emotional connection.
   - **Creative Adaptation**:
     - "With lowered gaze, I ponder back home."
     - This emphasizes the introspective nature of the thought.

#### 5. **Combining the Translations**
   - **Overall Flow**: Combine all parts coherently while ensuring each part fits well together.
   - **Stylistic Choices
