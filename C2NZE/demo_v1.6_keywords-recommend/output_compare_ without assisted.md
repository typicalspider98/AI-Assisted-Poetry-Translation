Thoughts on a Quiet Night

Moonlight shines bright by my bed,
Like frost upon the ground, I said.
I lift my head—the moon so clear,
I bow it down—homesickness near.

(Alternative version for a more natural NZ English flow:)

Reflecting on a Still Night

Before my bed, the moonlight gleams,
Could it be frost upon the ground?
I gaze up at the silver beams,
Then drift to thoughts of homeward bound.

(Note: NZ English is very close to British English, so the translation keeps a poetic yet natural rhythm while avoiding slang. The second version adds slight flow adjustments to sound more conversational.)

Whakaaro i te Pō Mārie

Mōnaka te marama i mua i te moenga,
Me te hukapapa e whitia ana te whenua.
Ka titiro ake ki te marama mārama,
Ka huri whakaaro ki te kāinga i mahara ai.

Notes on the translation:
"Whakaaro i te Pō Mārie" – Uses Māori language (te reo Māori) for "Thoughts on a Quiet Night," keeping the serene tone.
"Mōnaka" – A poetic way to say "shining bright" (from "mōnaki," meaning to gleam).
"Hukapapa" – Means "frost," fitting the imagery of the original.
"Te kāinga i mahara ai" – "The home I remember," keeping the nostalgic tone.
