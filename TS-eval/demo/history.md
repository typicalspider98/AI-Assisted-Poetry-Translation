  "comment": "The candidate translation is mostly faithful to the original, capturing the key elements of moonlight, frost, and thoughts of home. However, it slightly condenses the original's structure by combining the first two lines into one, which may lose some of the original's contemplative pacing. The fluency is excellent, with natural and grammatical English. In terms of elegance, while the translation is clear, it lacks the poetic rhythm and stylistic nuance of the original, which is more evident in the reference translation's use of line breaks and parallel structure."

  "comment": "The candidate translation captures the essence of the original poem, maintaining the imagery of the moonlight and the emotional connection to the homeland. The use of 'marama' instead of 'moon' is a creative choice that may slightly alter the direct meaning but adds a unique touch. The translation is fluent and reads naturally in English, with a consistent rhyme scheme that enhances its poetic quality. However, the elegance could be slightly improved by using more traditional or universally understood terms, as 'marama' might not be familiar to all readers. Overall, it is a faithful and stylistically pleasing rendition."
